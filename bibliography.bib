 abstract = {This chapter applies dynamic programming to a choice between only two actions, to accept or reject a take-it-or-leave-it job offer. An unemployed worker faces a probability distribution of wage offers or job characteristics, from which a limited number of offers are drawn each period. Given his perception of the probability distribution of offers, the worker must devise a strategy for deciding when to accept an offer.The theory of search is a tool for studying unemployment. Search theory puts unemployed workers in a setting where sometimes they choose to reject available offers and to remain unemployed now because they prefer},
